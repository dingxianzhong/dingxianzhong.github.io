I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student supervised by Prof. [Wan Du](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/wdu) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of California, Merced (UCM)](https://www.ucmerced.edu/). Before moving to Merced in 2018, I received his master's degree from Shandong University and bachelor's degree from Taishan University.

Honors and Awards

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
