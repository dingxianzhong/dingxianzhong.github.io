I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate supervised by Prof. [Wan Du](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/wdu) and Prof. [Alberto Cerpa](http://www.andes.ucmerced.edu/~acerpa/) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of California, Merced (UCM)](https://www.ucmerced.edu/). Before moving to Merced in 2018, I received my master's degree from Shandong University and bachelor's degree from Taishan University.


Research Interests
======
My research interests mainly lie in Applied Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Edge Computing, Wireless Networking and Internet of Things.
